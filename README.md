# GLATAR-App 

This is a Shiny App that interfaces with the GLATAR database to provide a 
seamless and rich interface with the GLATAR database. 

This app has the the ability to upload (i.e., 
if you are a contributing member), map, view raw data (i.e., 
if you are a contributing member), view summarised data, 
and view scatter plots of the raw data and can be found at 
[glatar.org](https://glatar.org/).

Many of the functions created in this project have been moved to package
`{glatar}` which will eventually be loaded and a lot of the structure of 
this project will fall into being documented in that package. The 
GitHub repo can be found [here](https://github.com/benjaminhlina/glatar) 
with the pkgdown webpage being found 
[here](https://benjaminhlina.github.io/glatar/). 

This app has used LLMs as a tool to assisted in development, however, any code that has been generated by LLMs has been meticulously screened, edited and redeveloped. 

# Contribution and Issue Policy 

This repository will not be accepting, LLM submitted PRs nor PRs that contain directly copy and pasted code from LLMs that has not be vetted and edited. 

If you would like to contribute please feel free to fork the repository, create a branch, implement your changes and submit a PR for review.   

Issues that are submitted by LLMs and/or copied and pasted from LLMs will be deleted and ignored as the issuer needs to have the ability to be able to write their own issues. If you cannot be bothered to do such then do not make issue on this repository.
